Novel IIoT predictive maintenance approach using Federated Learning and Explainable AI. Integrates decentralized sensor data for collaborative, privacy-preserving model training with interpretable AI insights to optimize industrial operations.

Overview

Predictive maintenance is a cornerstone of industrial optimization, aimed at reducing downtime and maintenance costs. This project introduces a novel approach that integrates Federated Learning (FL) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to revolutionize predictive maintenance strategies within the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments.

Methodology
Our approach harnesses decentralized sensor data collected from a variety of IoT devices, including drones across multiple industrial plants. This enables collaborative and privacy-preserving model training through a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) federated algorithm. Each IoT device contributes local updates, improving the global model's accuracy while maintaining compliance with strict data privacy standards.

Explainable AI Integration
In the context of industrial maintenance, transparency in decision-making processes is paramount. We address the often opaque nature of AI models by incorporating XAI techniques, such as Counterfactual Explanations and Feature Importance Analysis, employing SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). These methods provide clear, interpretable insights into how various factors—temperature, vibration, rotor speed, and environmental conditions like fog, dust, and smoke—affect machinery performance.

Results and Impact
The methodology has been rigorously tested with operational datasets from the manufacturing and process industries. Our findings demonstrate significant enhancements in predicting equipment failures and optimizing maintenance schedules. The integration of FL and XAI not only improves predictive accuracy but also equips industrial engineers and managers with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions.

Conclusion
This project establishes a scalable, efficient framework for advanced predictive maintenance in IIoT, blending privacy, accuracy, and explainability. It is a step forward in deploying robust AI solutions in critical industrial applications, promoting better asset management and operational efficiency.
